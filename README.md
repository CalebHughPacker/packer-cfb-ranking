## Overview

**Project Title**:
CFB Data Analysis
**Project Description**:
I analyze with data with the intention of finding certain predictive metrics that can determine the which teams 
would be superior to others on a neutral field. I answer questions regarding who the best teams are offensively
and defensively. I also answer the question of how teams compare to each other in passing offense and in rushing offense. 
Finally I answer the overall question of how all teams could be ranked in order from best to worst.Â 
**Project Goals**:
To accurately identify patterns in data that can be used to identify why some teams ay perform better than others

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Continue to improve on the methodology, imitading real-life sports analysis
* [ ] Represent Data visually (this was a goal for this sprint that unfortunately did not materialize)
* [ ] Allow the user to choose between different views from a menu rather than presenting everything at once
